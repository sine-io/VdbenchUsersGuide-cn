The basic functionality of Vdbench has been created to test and report the performance of one or more raw devices, and optionally one or more large file system files.

Starting release 405 a second type of performance workload has been added to assist with the testing of file systems.

 

Vdbench file system workloads revolve around two key sets of parameters:

· A *File System Anchor*, consisting of a directory name, and a directory and file structure that will be created under that anchor. Structure information consists of directory depth, directory width, number of files, and file sizes. Multiple file anchors may be defined and used concurrently. A maximum of 32 million files per anchor are supported. (32 million when running 32bit Java, 128 million with 64bit Java. Note that you will need to make sure your java heap size is large enough. Check your ./vdbench script for your -Xmx value. Also look for GcTracker information in this document.

· A *File System Operation*. File system operations are directory create/delete, file create/delete, file read/write, file open/close, access, setattr and getattr.

 

Parameter structure:

· File System Definition (FSD): This parameter describes the directory and file structure that will be created.

· File system Workload Definition (FWD) is used to specify the FSD(s) to be used and specifies miscellaneous workload parameters.

· Run Definition (RD) has a set of parameters that controls the file system workloads that will be executed.

 

Each time Vdbench starts it needs to know the current status of all the files, unless of course format=yes is specified. When you have loads of files, querying the directories can take quite a while. To save time, each time when Vdbench terminates normally the current status of all the files is stored in file ‘vdb_control.file’ in the anchor directory. This control file is then read at the start of the next run to eliminate the need to re-establish the current file status using directory searches.

When using ‘shared=yes’ as an FSD parameter this control file however will not be maintained.



 

#### **1.19.1** ***\*Directory and file\**** ***\*names\****

 

Directory names are generated as follows: vdb_x_y.dir, e.g. vdb1_1.dir

Where ‘x’ represents the depth of this directory (as in depth=nn), and ‘y’ represents the width (as in width=nn).

File names are generated as follows: vdb_f*nnnn*.file

Where ‘*nnnn*’ represents a sequence number starting at zero.

 

Note: until Vdbench50407 all file numbers started at one in each new directory. Starting 50407 all files are continuously numbered, starting at zero. This makes it much easier diagnosing problems; no longer looking for ‘which vdb_f0055.file was this?’.

 

Example: fsd=fsd1,anchor=dir1,depth=2,width=2,files=2

```shell
find dir1 | grep file
dir1/vdb_control.file
dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0000.file
dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0001.file
dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0002.file
dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0003.file
dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0004.file
dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0005.file
dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0006.file
dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0007.file
```

 

File ‘vdb_control.file’ contains a description of the current directory and file structure. This file is there to allow consecutive Vdbench tests that use an *existing* structure to make sure that the existing structure matches the current parameter settings.

During a cleanup of an existing directory structure Vdbench only deletes files and directories that contain this naming pattern. No other files will be deleted. So rest assured that if you specify

/root as your anchor directory you won’t lose your system J

 

Files by default are created in the lowest directory level. When specifying ‘distribution=all’, files will be created in every directory I expect to build more detailed file structures in the future.

***FEEDBACK NEEDED!\***

  

#### **1.19.2** ***\*File system sample parameter\**** ***\*file\****

 

*fsd=fsd1,anchor=/dir1,depth=2,width=2,files=2,size=128k fwd=fwd1,fsd=fsd1,operation=read,xfersize=4k,fileio=sequential,fileselect=random,threads=2 rd=rd1,fwd=fwd1,fwdrate=max,format=yes,elapsed=10,interval=1*

 

This parameter file will use a directory structure of 4 directories and 8 files (see above for file names). The RD parameter ‘format=yes’ causes the directory structure to be completely created



 

(after deleting any existing structure), including initialization of all files to the requested size of 128k.

After the format completes the following will happen for 10 seconds at a rate of 100 reads per second:

· Start two threads (threads=2; 1 thread is default).

· Each thread:

o Randomly selects a file (fileselect=random)

o Opens this file for read (operation=read)

o Sequentially reads 4k blocks (xfersize=4k) until end of file (size=128k)

o Closes the file and randomly selects another file.

 

This is a very simple example. Much more complex scenarios are possible when you use the complete set of Vdbench parameters. Be aware though that complexity comes at a price. For instance, you can’t read or write before a file is created and you can’t create a file before its parent directory is created. The ‘format=yes’ parameter can be very helpful here, even though it is possible to do your own format using mkdir, create and write operations.
