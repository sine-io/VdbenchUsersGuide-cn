This tool compares two sets of Vdbench output directories and shows the delta iorate or fwdrate and response time and optionally the data rate in 9 different colors: light green is good, dark green is better, red is bad, etc. Look at sample screen below.

 

You may give the tool either two Vdbench output directories, e.g. /run1 and /run2, or the parents of several Vdbench output directories, e.g. /test1 and /test2, where test1 and test2 have one or more subdirectories, e.g. /test1/run1, /test1/run2, etc.

 

To run Vdbench workload compare, enter './vdbench compare output1 output2' Optional: ‘-o out.txt’ will create a tab separated file of the results without displaying.

 

You can also start it as follows:

./vdbench compare old output1 output2 new output3 output4

 

This will calculate the averages of ‘old’ tests 1+2 and the average of ‘new’ tests 3+4 and will report the deltas.

 

Vdbench Compare now also has a ‘search’ option where the Run information will be searched for search arguments, in the example using search values ‘xfersize’ and ‘512k’.
