*Warning: specifying a directory and file structure is easy. However, it is also very easy to make it too large. Width=5,depth=5,files=5 results in 3905 directories and 15625 files!*

*Vdbench allows 32 million files per FSD, 128 million when running 64bit java. About 64 bytes of Java heapspace is needed per file, possibly causing memory problems. You may have to update the ‘Xmx’ parameter in your ./vdbench script.*



 

#### **1.28.1** ***\*‘fsd=name’: Filesystem Storage Definition\**** ***\*name\****

 

‘fsd=’ uniquely identifies each File System Definition. The FSD name is used by the Filesystem Workload Definition (FWD) parameter to identify which FSD(s) to use for this workload.

 

When you specify ‘default’ as the FSD name, the values entered will be used as default for all FSD parameters that follow.

 

#### **1.28.2** ***\*‘anchor=’: Directory\**** ***\*anchor\****

 

The name of the directory where the directory structure will be created. This anchor may not be a parent or child directory of an anchor defined in a different FSD. If this anchor directory is the same as an anchor directory in a different FSD the directory structure (width, depth etc) must be identical. If this directory does not exist, Vdbench will create it for you. If you also want Vdbench to create this directory’s parent directories, specify [‘create_anchor=yes’.](#_bookmark59)

Example: anchor=/file/system/

 

#### **1.28.3** ***\*‘count=(nn,mm)’ Replicate\**** ***\*parameters\****

 

This parameter allows you to quickly create a sequence of FSDs, e.g. fsd=fsd,anchor=/dir,count=(1,5) results in fsd1-fsd5 for /dir1 through /dir5

 

 

#### **1.28.4** ***\*‘shared=’ FSD\**** ***\*sharing.\****

 

With Vdbench running multiple slaves and optionally multiple hosts, communications between slaves and hosts about a file’s status becomes difficult. The overhead involved to have all these slaves communicate with each other about what they are doing with the files just becomes too expensive. You don’t want one slave to delete a file that a different slave is currently reading or writing. Vdbench therefore does not allow you to share FSDs across slaves and hosts.

 

That of course all sounds great until you start working with huge file systems. You just filled up 500 terabytes of disk files and you then decide that you want to share that data with one or more remote hosts. Recreating this whole file structure from scratch just takes too long. What to do?

 

When specifying ‘shared=yes’, Vdbench will allow you to share a File System Definition (FSD). It does this by allowing each slave to use only every ‘nth’ file as is defined in the FSD file structure, where ‘n’ equals the amount of slaves.

 

This means that the different hosts won’t step on each other’s toes, with one exception: When you specify ‘format=yes’, Vdbench first deletes an already existing file structure. Since this can be an old file structure, Vdbench cannot spread the file deletes around, letting each slave delete his ‘nth’ file. Each slave therefore tries to delete ALL files, but will not generate an error message if a delete fails (because a different slave just deleted it). These failed deletes will be counted and reported however in the ‘[Miscellaneous statistics’](#_bookmark198), under the



 

‘FILE_DELETE_SHARED’ counter. The ‘FILE_DELETES’ counter however can contain a count higher than the amount of files that existed. I have seen situations where multiple slaves were able to delete the same file at the same time without the OS passing any errors to Java.

 

If you're sure you will want to delete an existing file structure each time you run, you can of course also code startcmd="rm -rf /file/anchor" which will do the delete for you. Be careful though; Vdbench only deletes its own files, while 'rm -rf /root' deletes anything it finds.

 

#### **1.28.5** ***\*‘width=’: Horizontal directory\**** ***\*count\****

 

This parameter specifies how many directories to create in each new directory. [See above for an](#_bookmark155) [example](#_bookmark155).

 

 

#### **1.28.6** ***\*‘depth=’: Vertical directory\**** ***\*count\****

 

This parameter specifies how many levels of directories to create under the anchor. [See above for](#_bookmark156) [an example](#_bookmark156).

 

#### **1.28.7** ***\*‘files=’: File\**** ***\*count\****

 

This parameter specifies how many files to create in the lowest level of directories. [See above for](#_bookmark155) [an example](#_bookmark155). Note that you need at least one file per ‘fwd=xxx,threads=’ parameter specified. If there are not enough files, a thread may try to find an available file up to 10,000 times before it gives up.

 

Vdbench for each directory or file keeps track of a lot of information. That requires about 100 bytes per directory/file in the java heap. I suggest that you plan for about 200 bytes worth of java heap size though, this to accommodate very fast selection and switching of different files, and then avoid possible Garbage Collection issues. See 'GcTracker' information in thism document.

 

#### **1.28.8** ***\*‘sizes=’: File\**** ***\*sizes\****

 

This parameter specifies the size of the files. Either specify a single file size, or a set of pairs, where the first number in a pair represents file size, and the second number represents the percentage of the files that must be of this size. E.g. sizes=(32k,50,64k,50)

 

When you specify ‘sizes=(nnn,0)’, Vdbench will create files with an average size of ‘nnn’ bytes. There are some rules though related to the file size that is ultimately used:

· If size > 10m, size will be a multiple of 1m

· If size > 1m, size will be multiple of 100k

· If size > 100k, size will be multiple of 10k

· If size < 100k, size will be multiple of 1k.



 

#### **1.28.9** ***\*‘openflags=’: Optional file system ‘open’\**** ***\*parameters\****

 

Use this parameter to pass extra flags to open request (See: man open(2)) Flags currently supported: O_DSYNC, O_RSYNC, O_SYNC.

See also [‘openflags=’: Control over open() system call.](#_bookmark92)

 

 

#### **1.28.10** ***\*‘totalsize=’: Create files up to a specific total file\**** ***\*size.\****

 

This parameter stops the creation of new files after the requested total amount of file space is reached. Be aware that the ‘depth=’, ‘width=’, ‘files=’ and ‘sizes=’ parameter values must be large enough to accommodate this request. See also the RD ‘fortotal=‘ parameter.

Example: totalsize=100g See also ['format=limited'](#_bookmark188)

#### **1.28.11** ***\*‘workingsetsize=nn’ or\**** ***\*‘wss=nn’\****

 

While the depth, width, files and sizes parameters define the maximum possible file structure, ‘totalsize=’ if used specifies the amount of files and file space to create.

‘workingsetsize=’ creates a subset of the file structure of those files that will be used during this run. If for instance you have 200g worth of files, and 32g of file system cache, you can specify ‘wss=32g’ to make sure that after a warmup period, all your file space fits in file system cache. Can also be used with ‘forworkingsetsize’ or ‘forwss’.
