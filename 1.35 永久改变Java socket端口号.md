You can temporarily override the port numbers used by Vdbench to communicate between the master and the slaves (5570), or the port numbers used for Vdbench’s own RSH ‘daemon’ (5560).

 

To do this you must create file ‘portnumbers.txt’ in the Vdbench installation directory, or if you run Vdbench multi-host, in each Vdbench installation directory.

Content of this file:

 

masterslaveport=nnnn

rshdeamonport=nnnn  (Yes, this is a hard coded ‘daemon’ spelling error )

 

Make sure that if you have some firewall software installed that Java is allowed to use these ports.
