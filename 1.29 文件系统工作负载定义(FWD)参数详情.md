#### **1.29.1** ***\*‘fwd=name’: File system Workload Definition\**** ***\*name\****

 

‘fwd=’ uniquely identifies each File system Workload Definition. The FWD name is used by the Run Definition (RD) parameter to identify which FWDs to use for this workload.

 

When you specify ‘default’ as the FWD name, the values entered will be used as default for all FWD parameters that follow.

 

#### **1.29.2** ***\*‘fsd=’: which File System Definitions to\**** ***\*use\****

 

This parameter specifies which FSDs to use for this workload. Example: fsd=(fsd1,fsd2)

 

#### **1.29.3** ***\*‘fileio=’: random or sequential\**** ***\*I/O\****

 

Default: fileio=sequential

 

This parameter specifies the type of I/O that needs to be done on each file, either random or sequential. A random LBA will be generated on a data transfer size boundary.

 

|                        |                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fileio=random          | Random I/O, one thread per file only.                        |
| fileio=(random,shared) | Random I/O, but allow multiple threads to share thesame file. |
| fileio=sequential      | Sequential I/O (default)                                     |
| fileio=sequentialnz    | Sequential i/o, but starting at a random block in the file.  |
| fileio=(seq,delete)    | Delete the file before writing.                              |

 

#### **1.29.4** ***\*‘rdpct=’: specify read\**** ***\*percentage\****

 

This parameter allows you to mix reads and writes. Using operation=read only allows you to do reads, operation=write allows you to only do writes. Specify rdpct= however, and you will be able to mix reads and writes within the same selected file. Note that for sequential this won’t make much sense. You could end with read block1, write block2, read block3, etc. For random I/O however this makes perfect sense.

 

#### **1.29.5** ***\*‘stopafter=’: how much\**** ***\*I/O?\****

 

This parameter lets Vdbench know how much reads or writes to do against each file.



 

You may specify ‘stopafter=nn’ which will cause Vdbench to stop using this file after ‘nn’ blocks, or you may specify ‘stopafter=nn%’ which will stop processing after nn% of the requested file size is processed.

 

For random I/O Vdbench by default will stop after ‘file size’ bytes are read or written. This default prevents you from accidentally doing 100 million 8k random reads or writes against a single 8k file.

 

For sequential I/O Vdbench by default will always read or write the complete file.

When you specify ‘stopafter=’ though, Vdbench will only read or write the amount of data requested. The next time this file is used for sequential I/O however it will continue after the last block previously used.

This can be used to simulate a file ‘append’ when writing to a file.

 

#### **1.29.6** ***\*‘fileselect=’: which files to\**** ***\*select?\****

 

 

 

|                         |                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fileselect=random       | The randomizer used for this will be seeded using the current time of day in milliseconds, assuring you that we don’t alwayswill start with the next file. |
| fileselect=sequential   | Default, start with the first file                           |
| fileselect=sequentialnz | This will cause file selection to start with a randomly chosenfile. This option is mutually exclusive with fileselect=once. |
| fileselect=(xxx,once)   | Stop after ANY FSD has all of its files referenced           |
| fileselect=(poisson,nn) | Poisson distribution is designed to skew the workload across the file access. Poisson takes one parameter to increase the skew when dealing with very large numbers of files. See distribution below. Default for 'nn' is 3.(For those that received a very early copy of this code, this equates to 'fileselect=(skewed,midpoint=3)' |

 

 

 

This parameter allows you to select directories and files for processing either sequentially in the order in which they have been specified using the depth=, width=, and files= FSD parameters, or whether they should be selected randomly. See also [Directory and file names](#_bookmark154).

 

Note though that when you use fileio=(random,shared) with as one of the objectives the setting of your active working set size, fileselect=random may not be the correct thing to do. You may end up with multiple threads using the same file. The total working set size therefore may not be what you expect.

 

You may also specify fileselect=(xxxxx,once). This allows each file to be used only ONCE, and Vdbench will terminate after the last file has been processed. of any FSD.

As usual, make sure that your elapsed time is long enough to get this far.



 

Note: fileselect=once stops after the **FIRST** FSD has accessed it's last file. This means that other FSDs may not have referenced its last file yet.

 

Example of Poisson distribution: This shows that when you specify 'fileselect=(poisson,3)' 50% of the file accesses are made within the first 2,000 of 10,000 files.

#### **1.29.7** ‘xfersizes=’: data transfer sizes for read and\**** ***\*writes\****

 

This parameter specifies the data transfer size(s) to use for read and write operations. Either specify a single xfersize, or a set of pairs, where the first number in a pair represents xfersize, and the second number represents the percentage of the I/O requests that must use this size. E.g. xfersizes=(8k,50,16k,30,2k,20). Percentages of course must add up to 100.

 

#### **1.29.8** ***\*‘operation=’: which file system operation to\**** ***\*execute\****

 

Specifies a single file system operation that must be executed for this workload: Choose one: mkdir, rmdir, create, delete, open, close, read, write, access, getattr and setattr. If you need more than one operation specify ‘operations=’ in the Run Definition.

To allow for mixed read and write operations against the same file, specify fwd=xxx,rdpct=nn.

 

#### **1.29.9** ***\*‘skew=’: which percentage of the total\**** ***\*workload\****

 

The percentage of the total amount of work (specified by the fwdrate= parameter in the Run Definition) assigned to this workload. By default all the work is evenly distributed among all workloads.



 

#### **1.29.10** ***\*‘threads=’: how many concurrent operations for\**** ***\*this workload\****

 

Specifies how many concurrent threads to run for this workload. It should be clear that this does not mean that ‘n’ threads are running against each file, but instead it means that there will be ‘n’ concurrent files running this same workload. Unless overridden using the [fileio=(random,shared)](#_bookmark177) parameter *All file operations for a specific directory or file are single threaded.* See [Multi](#_bookmark197) [Threading and file system testing](#_bookmark197).

 

Make sure you always have at least one file for each thread. If not, one or more threads continue trying to find an available file, but Vdbench gives up after 10,000 consecutive failed attempts.

 

Note: until 50407 the document above stated that the thread count would be for each FSD. That turned out to be incorrect. It will be the total amount of threads for the FWD.

There is a problem though: The OS does not allow the starting of less than one threads so when divvying up the thread count to the requested FSDs and operations some integer rounding upwards will be done.

That means that if you ask for threads=1, but you have two FSDs, each FSD gets ONE thread for a total of TWO. Vdbench will warn you when this happens, but if you want to make sure that your thread count does NOT get adjusted, specify ‘fwd_thread_adjust=no’ as a general parameter. Vdbench will then abort after this warning message.

In above example, with the override, threads=1 will abort and you’ll have to specify threads=2 in order for the test to continue. Basically, the abort serves only as an signal that your threads=1 test won’t be possible and you consciously will have to  adjust the threadcount.
