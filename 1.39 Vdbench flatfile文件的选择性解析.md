It took me about 7 years, but I finally made some time to create a simple program that takes the flatfile, picks out the columns and rows that the user wants, and then writes it to a tab delimited file.

 

 Usage:

```shell
./vdbench parseflat -i flatfile.html -o output.csv [-c *col1 col2* ..]

[-a] [-f *col1* value1 *col2* value2 .. ..]

-i	input flatfile, e.g. output/flatfile.html

-o	output CSV file name (default stdout)

-c	which column to write to CSV. Columns are written in the order specified.

-f	filters: 'if (colX == valueX) ... ...' (Alphabetic compare)

-a	include only the 'avg' data. Default: include only non-avg data.
```



Example:

```shell
./vdbench parse -i output\flatfile.html -c run interval rate resp -f run rd1 -o out.csv 
```

This will give you file out.csv which can be directly read into Excel or StarOffice:

```shell
run,interval,rate,resp
rd1,1,104.0000,3.3225
rd1,2,119.0000,2.2137 
rd1,3,98.0000,3.6711 
rd1,4,104.0000,3.0038
rd1,5,99.0000,2.5214

```
