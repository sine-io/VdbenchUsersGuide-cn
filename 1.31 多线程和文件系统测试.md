By default, multi threading for file system testing does not mean that multiple threads will be concurrently using the same file. All individual file operations are done single threaded. Other threads however can be active with different files.

This behavior can be overridden when specifying ['fileio=(random,shared)'.](#_bookmark177)

 

Considering the complexity allowing directory creates, file creates, file reads and file writes against the same directory structure happening concurrently there are some pretty interesting scenarios that Vdbench has to deal with. Some of them:

· Creating a file before its parent directory or directories exist.

· Reading or writing a file that does not exist yet.

· Reading a file that has not been written yet.

· Deleting a file that is currently being read or written.

· Reading a file that does not exist while there are no new files being created.

 

When these things happen Vdbench will analyze the situation. For instance, if he wants to write to a file that does not exist, the code will check to see if any new files will be created during this run. If so, the current thread goes to sleep for a few microseconds, selects the next directory or file and tries again. If there are no file creates pending Vdbench will abort.

At the end of each run numerous statistics related to these issues will be reported in logfile.html and on stdout, with a brief explanation and with a count.

To identify deadlocks (which is an error situation and should be reported to me) Vdbench will abort after 10000 consecutive sleeps without a successful operation.

 

Note: there currently is a known deadlock situation where there are more threads than files. If you for instance specify 12 threads but only 8 files, 4 of the threads will continually be in the ‘try and sleep’ loop, ultimately when the run is long enough hitting the 10000 count.
