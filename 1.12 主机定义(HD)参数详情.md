#### **1.12.1** ***\*‘hd=host_label’\****

The host label is used for cross-referencing and reporting. Example: hd=localhost or hd=systemA

Use ‘localhost’ when you want to set values for the *current* host, the host where the Vdbench master JVM is running.

hd=default specifies the default settings to be used for all later HD parameters. For a complete example, [see example 5 ](#_bookmark225)below.

#### **1.12.2** ***\*‘system=system_name’\****

 

When running Vdbench in multi-host mode you specify here the system name of the system’s IP address, e.g. system=x.y.z.com or system=12.34.56.78.

 

#### **1.12.3** ***\*‘master=system_name/IP\**** ***\*address\****

 

The Vdbench slave normally connects back to the Vdbench master using the master's IP address. There are some situations though where that IP address can or may not be used.

By using the new 'master=' parameter the slave will now connect to either whatever is specified as 'master=zzzzzzzz', likely an IP address, or, when 'master=hostname' is used Vdbench will run the 'hostname' OS command and use that value which then is passed to the slave and used for connection back to the master.

 

#### **1.12.4** ***\*‘jvms=nnn’\****

 

This parameter tells Vdbench how many JVMs to use on this host. See ‘[Multi JVM Execution](#_bookmark34).

 

 

#### **1.12.5** ***\*‘vdbench=/vdbench/dir/name’\****

 

This tells Vdbench where it can find its installation directory on a remote host. Default: the same directory as currently used. Use double quotes (“) when a directory name has embedded blanks, for instance on windows systems.

Note that when ‘shell=vdbench’ is used this parameter is ignored since the Vdbench RSH residing on the remote system will you its current Vdbench install directory.



 

#### **1.12.6** ***\*‘shell=rsh | ssh |\**** ***\*vdbench’\****

 

For multi-host execution Vdbench by default uses RSH. You can optionally use SSH. If your target system does not have RSH or SSH or if you can’t get the proper settings on the local or remote systems to get RSH or SSH to work you can use Vdbench’s own RSH daemon by specifying shell=vdbench. On the target remote system you must do a one time start of ‘./vdbench rsh’ to star[t the Vdbench RSH daemon. ](#_bookmark43)This daemon of course will only work with Vdbench, and it is simply a small program that uses Java sockets to start a command and receive stdout/stderr output back. See also ‘[portnumbers.txt’.](#_bookmark230)

 

Note: If you have the MKS toolkit installed on your Windows system you may want to remove the MKS version of RSH. Experience has shown that the stdout and stderr output streams created by this version of RSH do not close properly therefore preventing Vdbench from recognizing the completion of a remote copy of Vdbench.

 

#### **1.12.7** ***\*‘user=xxxx’\****

 

Used for RSH and SSH. Note: it is the user’s responsibility to properly define the RSH or SSH security settings on the local and on the remote hosts.

 

#### **1.12.8** ***\*‘mount=xxx’\****

 

This parameter is mainly useful when doing some serious multi-host file system testing. If you for instance have 20 target clients that you have connected all to the same file system it is nice not to have to manually create all these mount points and issue the mount commands.

 

The ‘mount=’ parameter can be used in two places:

\- As part of a Host Definition (HD).

\- As part of a Run Definition (RD).

 

When used as a Host Definition parameter you specify the complete mount command that you want issued on the remote system, e.g.:

mount="mount -o forcedirectio /dev/dsk/c2t6d0s0 /export/h01"

 

Vdbench will create the mount point directory if needed, in this example /export/h01 and then will issue the mount command.

 

When used as a Run Definition parameter (RD), you only specify the mount options, e.g. mount="-o noforcedirectio".

Vdbench will replace the (possible) mount options as specified as part of the Host Definition with the newly specified mount options.

When you code ‘mount=reset’, the original mount command as specified will be executed.



 

Note, that for normal file system testing operations, each host will need his own FSD parameter, unless the ‘shared=yes’ FSD parameter is used in which case all hosts can use the same.
