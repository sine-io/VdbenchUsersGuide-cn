Vdbench has several small utility functions to help you with your day-to-day Vdbench testing. Just enter ‘./vdbench xxx’, for instance ./vdbench sds’.

Vdbench提供了一些小型的实用工具函数，以协助您进行日常的Vdbench测试。只需输入‘./vdbench xxx’即可，例如‘./vdbench sds’。

 

### 1. ./vdbench sds: Generate Vdbench SD parameters.

Sick and tired of entering 200 50+ hexadecimal Solaris device names without any typos? Run ./vdbench sds and Vdbench will do it for you.

See  [Vdbench SD parameter generation tool.](#_bookmark240) This works for Solaris, Linux and Windows,

对于输入200个以上带有50个以上十六进制字符的Solaris设备名称而不出现任何拼写错误感到厌烦了吗？运行./vdbench sds，Vdbench将为您解决这个问题。

参见[Vdbench SD参数生成工具](#_bookmark240)。这适用于Solaris、Linux和Windows。

 

### 2. ./vdbench jstack: Display java execution stacks of active Vdbench runs.

Like all software, there always is a chance that there is a problem or bug. Code hangs are very difficult to fix if you don’t know where the problem is. ‘./vdbench jstack’ will print out the active Java execution stack of all currently running Java programs. Run this before killing Vdbench.

和所有软件一样，总有可能存在问题或漏洞。如果不知道问题出在哪里，代码挂起将非常难以解决。‘./vdbench jstack’ 将打印出所有当前运行的Java程序的活动Java执行栈。记得在终止Vdbench之前运行它哦。



Must be run using the same user id used for Vdbench; you also must be using a JDK/SDK, since that includes the java jstack executable.

必须使用与Vdbench相同的用户ID来运行；您还必须使用JDK/SDK，因为它包含Java jstack可执行文件。

### 3. ./vdbench rsh: Vdbench RSH daemon.

Not every OS has an RSH or SSH daemon available (windows for instance) for testing, and some times getting the available RSH or SSH to do what you want just does not work.

并非每个操作系统都有可用的RSH或SSH守护程序（例如Windows）用于测试，有时候让现有的RSH或SSH按照您的要求工作可能不太顺利。



For those situations, Vdbench has his own (primitive) RSH daemon. It only works for Vdbench. Just run ./vdbench rsh’ once on the target system, and Vdbench will open a java socket that will be used to start Vdbench slaves on that host and return its stdout and stderr output.

在这种情况下，Vdbench提供了自己的（简单的）RSH守护程序。它只适用于Vdbench。只需在目标系统上运行一次‘./vdbench rsh’，Vdbench就会打开一个Java socket服务，用于在该主机上启动Vdbench的从节点，并返回其标准输出和标准错误输出。

 

### 4. ./vdbench print: Print any block on any lun or file.

Especially when running into data corruption issues identified by Data Validation, being able to see what the current content is of a data block can be very useful.

尤其是在遇到数据验证发现的数据损坏问题时，能够查看一个数据块当前内容的能力非常有用。



语法：./vdbench print device lba xfersize [-f openflag]

1. device: 任意设备或文件名

2. lba: 逻辑字节地址。如果是十六进制，可以使用0x作为前缀。您也可以使用k或m表示千字节或兆字节。

3. xfersize: 要打印的块的长度。

4. -f openflag: 参见‘openflags=’，以向操作系统的open()调用添加一个额外的标志。

  

### 5. ./vdbench edit: Simple full screen editor, or ‘back to the future’.

It was around 1978 that I went away from line editors, never expecting to have to go back there. When starting to work with Unix systems back in 2000 all I found was vi. By that time I had lost all my Neanderthal habits, so vi just wasn’t the way to go for me.

大约在1978年，我不再使用行编辑器，从未预料到会回到那里。当2000年开始使用Unix系统时，我发现只有vi编辑器。可是我已经失去了所有的原始习惯，所以vi对我来说并不适合。



It took me less than half an hour to write a full screen editor using Java, and here it is: Just run ./vdbench edit /file/name and the convenience of the 21st century will be with you.

我用不到半小时就用Java编写了一个全屏编辑器：只需运行./vdbench edit /file/name，21世纪的便利就会降临。



### 6. ./vdbench compare: Compare Vdbench test results.

This function compares two sets of Vdbench output directories and shows the delta iops and response time and optionally the data rate in 9 different colors: light green is good, dark green is better, red is bad, etc. See also:  [Vdbench Workload Compare](#_bookmark238).

There is a much more complete Workload Compare available in Swat.

 此功能用于比较两组Vdbench输出目录，并以9种不同颜色展示IOPS和响应时间的变化，以及可选的数据速率：浅绿色表示好，深绿色表示更好，红色表示差等。另见：[Vdbench工作负载比较](#_bookmark238)。

Swat中有一个更完整的工作负载比较功能。



### 7. ./vdbench parse: Parse Vdbench flatfile.

The Vdbench flatfile parser is a simple program that takes the flatfile, picks out the columns and rows that the user wants, and then writes it to a tab delimited file. See [Vdbench flatfile selective parsing.](#_bookmark237)

 

###  8. ./vdbench csim: Compression simulator

This utility will read an x% sample of a lun or a bunch of files, calls the java implementation of gzip, and will report average compression ratio.

```shell
./vdbench csim

Usage: ./csim [-l nnn] [-p nnn] [-x nnn] [-s nnn] disk1, disk2, file1, file2, .....

-l nnn: gzip compression level to use, default 1
-p nnn: which percentage of data to read, default 0.1%
-s nnn: subset percentage. e.g. -s10 reports compression for each 10% of the volume
-u nnn: transfer size unit in bytes for blocks to be read and compressed. Default 128k disk1, file1, ...: up to 10000 disk or file names or windows drive letters (c)
```

And yes, maybe some day I'll do this sampling using multi-threading… 



### 9. ./vdbench dsim: Dedup simulator

This utility reads a lun or some files, creates a hash of the data blocks, stores the resulting hash into a table, and counts the amount of time that a duplicate block has been identified.

This tool was written to help me verify that the Dedup data pattern generated by Vdbench were correct, and likely won't be able to handle too huge an amount of data.

Each unique data block needs about 100 bytes of java heap memory, so if you have 400gb worth of 4k unique blocks to analyze you'll need about 10gb of java heap space.

 

```shell
./vdbench dsim

Usage: ./dsim [-n sss] [-w nn] [-f nn] [-u nnnk] disk1, disk2, dir1, dir2, file1, file2, ..... 

Where:
-u nnn: dedup unit, amount of bytes to be used for deduplication
-n sss: Notify about progress every 'sss' seconds, default 60.
-w nnn: How many 'worker threads' hashing a block. Default 4.
-f nnn: How many 'lun/file threads' reading luns and files. Default 2. disk1, file1, ...: up to 10000 disk or file names or windows drive letters (c)
```

Each 'lun/file thread' reads a one mb block and has 'worker threads' threads hashing each 'dedup unit' piece of data.

While csim can save resources by just sampling a lun, for dedup that won't work, so dedup needs to process the whole lun.



### 10. ./vdbench printjournal: print (subset of) .jnl file

This utility may be of help while trying to understand the history of a corrupted data block, a corruption discovered when journaling is active. The whole journal will be printed if no lba has been specified.

 

```shell
Usage:
./vdbench printjournal xxx.jnl [-l nnn]

xxx.jnl:	your .jnl file
-l 4096		logical byte address
-l 4k		k/m/g logical byte address
-l 0x1000	Hex logical byte address
```

 

### 11. ./vdbench showlba: Visualize data access pattern

This utility requires the use of the 'showlba=yes' parameter. This parameter causes each Vdbench slave to create a trace file that then can be read and displayed by the showlba utility. A sample screenshot below, the result of the following small test:

*showlba=yes sd=sd1,lun=w:\temp\quick_vdbench_test,size=40m sd=sd2,lun=w:\temp\quick_vdbench_test,size=40m wd=wd1,sd=sd\*,xf=1k,rdpct=50,hotband=(0,30) rd=rd1,wd=wd1,iorate=20000,elapsed=5,interval=1*

 

Note: this is primitive, but it works. J You can find '*showlba.txt' files in your current directory.



Note: please realize that writing this trace file may slow down your workload, and running 24 hours at one million iops may also cause you some problems, so be careful with this.

 

```shell
Usage: ./vdbench showlba [-w WDname] [-s SDname] [-o output.png] *.showlba.txt

Where:
-s SDname:	Filter looking for sd=SDname
-w WDname:	Filter looking for wd=WDname
-o output.png	Do not display, create PNG file instead.
*.showlba.txt	. . . .	trace file(s) created by showlba=yes
```
