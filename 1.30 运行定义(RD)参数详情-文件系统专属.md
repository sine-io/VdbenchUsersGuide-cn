#### **1.30.1** ***\*‘fwd=’: which File system Workload Definitions to\**** ***\*use\****

 

This parameter tells Vdbench which FWDs to use during this run. Specify a single workload as ‘fwd=fwd1’ or multiple workloads either by entering them individually ‘fwd=(fwd1,fwd2,fwd3)’, a range ‘fwd=(fwd1-fwd3’)’ or by using a wildcard character ‘fwd=fwd*’.

 

#### **1.30.2** ***\*‘fwdrate=’: how many operations per\**** ***\*second.\****

 

|                        |                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fwdrate=100            | Run a workload of 100 operations per second                  |
| fwdrate=(100,200,…)    | Run a workload of 100 operations per second, then 200, etc.  |
| fwdrate=(100-1000,100) | Run workloads with operations per second from 100 to 1000,incremented by 100. |
| fwdrate=curve          | Create a performance curve.                                  |
| fwdrate=max            | Run the maximum amount of operations per second. Note: File System workloads do not allow for uncontrolled max as is available for SD/WD workloads: Vdbench will keepworkloads synchronized using a default workload skew. |

 

This parameter specifies the combined rate per second to generate for all requested file system operations.

See also ['iorate=nn': One or More I/O Rates](#_bookmark113).

 

There is a specific reason why the label ‘fwdrate’ was chosen compared to ‘iorate’ for raw I/O workload. Though usually most of the operations executed against file systems will be reads and writes, and therefore I/O operations, Vdbench also allows for several other operations: mkdir, rmdir, create, delete, open, close, access, getattr and setattr. These operations are all metadata operations which are therefore not considered I/O operations.



 

 

 

#### **1.30.3** ***\*‘format=’: pre-format the directory and file\**** ***\*structure\****

 

When specifying format=yes, this parameter requests that at the start of each run any old directory structure first is deleted and then the new one recreated.

 

Any format request (unless format=restart) will delete every file and directory that follows the directory and file naming that Vdbench generates. Don’t worry; Vdbench won’t accidentally delete your root directory. See also [Directory and file names.](#_bookmark155)

Be careful though with format: you may just have spent 48 hours creating a file structure. You don’t want to accidentally leave ‘format=yes’ in your parameter file when you want to reuse the just created file structure.

 

Also understand that if you **change** the file structure a format run is required. Vdbench keeps track of what the previous file structure was and will refuse to continue if it has been changed. You may however plan for growth of your file system. The directory and file structure specified will be the maximum; you can use both totalsize= and workingsetsize= to use subsets of this maximum.

 

A format implies that first all the directories are created. After this all files will be sequentially formatted using 128k as a transfer size.

 

When specifying ‘format=yes’ for a file system workload Vdbench automatically inserts an extra workload and Run Definition to do the formatting. Defaults for this workload are threads=8,xfersize=128k.

To override this, add fwd=format,threads=nn,xfersize=nn. You can also specify ‘openflags=xxx’. All other parameters used in fwd=format will be ignored.

 

|               |                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| format=       | When using more than one option use parenthesis: format=(yes,restart)Default: format=no |
| no            | No format required, though the existing file structure must match the structuredefined for this FSD. |
| yes           | Vdbench will first delete the current file structure and then will create the filestructure again. It will then execute the run you requested in the current RD. |
| restart       | Vdbench will create only files that have not been created and will also expand files that have not reached their proper size. (This is where totalsize and workingsetsizecan come into play). |
| only          | The same as ‘yes’, but Vdbench will NOT execute the current RD. |
| dir(ectories) | The same as ‘yes’, but it will only create the directories.  |
| clean         | Vdbench will only delete the current file structure and NOT execute the currentRD. |
| once          | This overrides the default behavior that a format is done for each forxxx parameterloop done. |
| limited       | The format will terminate after 'elapsed= seconds instead of after all files or filesselected for totalsize= have been formatted. |
| complete      | May only be used with 'format=no', and will tell Vdbench that the format has been completed, but that Vdbench should not try to verify the status of each directory and file by doing directory searches. Results are unpredictable of course if one ormore directories or files are missing or files have not reached their expected size. VERY dangerous when deleting or creating directories or files during your test. |

 

#### **1.30.4** ***\*‘operations=’: which file system operations to\**** ***\*run\****

 

Specifies one or more of the available file system operations: mkdir, rmdir, create, delete, open, close, read, write, access, getattr and setattr. This overrides the ‘fwd=xxx,operations=’ parameter.

E.g. operations=mkdir or operations=(read,getattr)

 

This can get tricky, but Vdbench will be able to handle it all. If for instance you do not have an existing file structure, and you ask for operations=read, Vdbench will fail because there are no files available. Code operations=(create,read) and Vdbench will still fail because there still are no directories available. Code operations=(mkdir,create,read) will also fail because even though the files exist, they are still empty. With operations=(mkdir,create,write,read) things should work just fine.

There’s one ‘gotcha’ here though: once all directories and files have been created the threads for those operations are terminated because there no longer is anything for them to do. This means that if you have specified for instance fwdrate=1000 the remaining threads for ‘read’ and ‘write’ will continue doing their requested portion of the total amount of work, and that is 250 operations per second each for a total of fwdrate=500.

 

A different way to do your own formatting of the file structure is run with ‘foroperations=(mkdir,create,write,read)’. For sequential write operations a create is done if the file does not exist.

 

 

#### **1.30.5** ***\*‘foroperations=’: create ‘for’ loop using\**** ***\*different operations\****

 

The ‘foroperations=' parameter is an override for all workload specific *operations* parameters, and allows multiple automatic executions of a workload with different operations.

While the ‘operations=’ parameter above does one run with all requested operations running at the same time, ‘foroperations=’ does one run per operation.

 

|                                         |                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| foroperations=read                      | Only do read operations                                      |
| foroperations=(read,write,delete,rmdir) | Does one run each first reading all files, then writing, and then deletes all directories and files (A test like this requires the directorystructure to first have been created by for instance using ‘format=yes’) |

#### **1.30.6** ***\*‘fordepth=’: create ‘for’ loop using different\**** ***\*directory depths\****

 

The ‘fordepth=' parameter is an override for all FSD specific *depth* parameters, and allows multiple automatic executions of a directory structure with different depth values..

 

|                    |                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fordepth =5        | One run using depth=5                                        |

The ‘forwidth=' parameter is an override for all FSD specific *width* parameters, and allows multiple automatic executions of a directory structure with different width values.

 

|                    |                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| forwidth =5        | One run using width=5                                        |

#### **1.30.8** ***\*‘forfiles=’: create ‘for’ loop using different amount of\**** ***\*files\****

 

The ‘forfiles=' parameter is an override for all FSD specific *files* parameters, and allows multiple automatic executions of a directory structure with different files values.

 

|                    |                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| forfiles =5        | One run using files=5                                        |

#### **1.30.9** ***\*‘forsizes=’: create ‘for’ loop using different file of\**** ***\*sizes\****



 

The ‘forsizes=' parameter is an override for all FSD specific *sizes* parameters, and allows multiple automatic executions of a directory structure with different file sizes.

When you use this parameter you cannot specify a distribution of file sizes as you can do using the [FSD definitions.](#_bookmark169)

 

|                    |                                                              |

#### **1.30.10** ***\*‘fortotal=’: create ‘for’ loop using different total file\**** ***\*sizes\****

 

This parameter is an override for the FSD ‘files=’ parameter. It allows you to create enough files to fill up the required amount of total file sizes, e.g. fortotal=(10g,20g). These values must be incremental. See also the [‘totalsize=’ ](#_bookmark171)parameter.

 

|                   |                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| fortotal=5g       | One run using fortotal=5g                                    |
| fortotal=(5g,10g) | One run with totalsize=5g, and then one run with totalsize=10g |

 

Note that this results in multiple format runs being done if requested. Since you do not want the second format to first delete the previous file structure you may specify format=(yes,restart).

 

#### **1.30.11** ***\*‘forwss=’: ‘for’ loop using working set\**** ***\*sizes.\****

This parameter overrides the FSD ‘[workingsetsize](#_bookmark172)=’ parameter forcing Vdbench to use only a subset of the file structure defined with the FSD.

 

|                  |                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| forwss=16g       | Uses only a 16g subset of the files specified in the FSD |
| forwss=(16g,32g) | Two runs: one for 16g and one for 32g.                   |
