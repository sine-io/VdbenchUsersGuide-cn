*Vdbench 'wrappers' or* *'how* *to monitor* *Vdbench'*



Vdbench is now almost 15 years old and through the years several users, to fit their own needs, have created a wrapper around Vdbench.

Wrappers doing things like "if X happens with Vdbench, do Y".

 

And then things get scary, because some 'if X' scenarios depend on something someone may have found over the years in one of the many Vdbench output files.

That then means that if I decide to change something these wrappers all of a sudden no longer work. Ouch #1.

And that then prevents these teams from using the latest versions of Vdbench. Ouch #2.

 

Several months ago I created what we can call an "Official Vdbench Status API", where I, though some mechanism, keep users informed about the current 'state' of a Vdbench test.

This API then will be fixed, allowing for stability for whoever decides to write a wrapper around Vdbench.

 

This is it: feedback is always welcome on the Oracle Vdbench Forum.

```shell
<pre>
* Vdbench status
* The objective of this file is to contain easily parseable information about
the current state of Vdbench.
* This then can serve as an 'official' interface for any software monitoring
the state of Vdbench.
* Each line of output will be immediately flushed to the file system, making
its content accessible by any monitoring program

All 'columns' are tab-delimited so that should help you parse stuff.
