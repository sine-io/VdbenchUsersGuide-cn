When not running MAX I/O rates, Vdbench uses Solaris 'sleep' functions. Because the default granularity of the clock timers is one 'clock tick' every 10 milliseconds, it is recommended to add 'set hires_tick=1' to */etc/system* and reboot.

This allows I/O's to be started about 10 milliseconds closer to their expected start time.
