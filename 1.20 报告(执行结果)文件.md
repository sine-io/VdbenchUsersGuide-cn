HTML files are written to the directory specified using the `-o` execution parameter.

These reports are all linked together from one starting point. Use your favorite browser and point at `summary.html`.

The following (see the report file examples) are created.

 

HTML文件将被写入到使用 `-o` 执行参数指定的目录中。

所有这些报告都会从一个起始点链接在一起。使用您喜欢的浏览器打开 `summary.html` 文件。

将创建以下报告文件（请参见报告文件示例）。

| [summary.html](#_bookmark201)         | Contains workload results for each run and interval. Summary.html also contains a link to all other html files, and <font color="blue">should be used as a starting point when using your browser for viewing.</font> For file system testing see [summary.html for file system testing](#_bookmark206) From a command prompt in windows just enter `start summary.html`; on a unix system, just enter `firefox summary.html &`. |

| parmscan.html                         | Contains a running <font color="#FF00000">trail</font>[^ 2 ] of what parameter data is currently being parsed. If a parsing or parameter error is given this file will show you the latest parameter that was being parsed. |
| *sdname*.html                         | Contains performance data for each defined Storage Definition. See summary.html for a description. You can suppress this report with `report=no_sd_detail` |
| *hostx.sdname*.html                   | Identical to sdname.html, but containing results for only one specific host. This report will be identical to sdname.html when not used in a multi-host environment. This report is only created when the `report=host_detail` parameter is used. |
| *hostx_n.sdname.html*                 | SD report for one specific slave. This report is only created when the `report=slave_detail` parameter is used. |
| [kstat.html](#_bookmark208)           | Contains Kstat summery performance data for Solaris          |
| hostx.kstat.html                      | Kstat summary report for one specific host. This report will be identical to kstat.html when not used in a multi-host environment. |

| [flatfile.html](#_bookmark212)        | A file containing detail statistics to be used for extraction and input for other reporting tools. See also [Parse Vdbench flatfile](#_bookmark47) |
| errorlog.html                         | Any I/O errors or Data Validation errors will be written here. |
| swat_mon.txt                          | This file can be imported into the Swat Performance Monitor allowing you to display performance charts of a Vdbench run. |
| swat_mon_total.txt                    | Similar to swat_mon.txt, but allows Swat to display only run totals. |
| swat_mon.bin                          | Similar to swat_mon.txt above, but for File System workload data. |
