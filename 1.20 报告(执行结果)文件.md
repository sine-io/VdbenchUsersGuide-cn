HTML files are written to the directory specified using the '-o' execution parameter.

These reports are all linked together from one starting point. Use your favorite browser and point at ‘summary.html’.

The following (see the report file examples) are created.

 

| [summary.html](#_bookmark201)         | Contains workload results for each run and interval. Summary.html also contains a link to all other html files, and should be used as a starting point when using your browser for viewing. For file system testing see [summary.html for file system testing](#_bookmark206)From a command prompt in windows just enter ‘start summary.html’; on a unix system, just enter ‘firefox summary.html &’. |
