### 1. ‘include=parmfile’

As specified earlier, there is a specific order in which these parameters must be specified, with the ‘General Parameters’ at the beginning of the parameter file.

 

There is however ONE exception: the ’include=*parmfile’* parameter. This can reside anywhere. It behaves like the good old fashioned #include statement for C code.

The file name specified will be inserted in-line into what is currently being read. You can use as many include= parameters needed.

 

One use of this parameter could be if you want to keep the SD or FSD parameters separated from the rest of the parameters. SDs and FSDs typically change frequently, while the rest of the parameters stay unchanged.

A different use could be for instance if you have created a fixed, complex ‘Application X’ set of workloads and you just want to include this existing workload in a new test run.

For instance include=payroll or include=email.

 

If you code only a file name and not a directory name, Vdbench will look for the file name in the directory of the file containing the current ‘include=’ statement.

 

### 2. 'data_errors=xxx': Terminate After Data Validation or I/O errors

Vdbench by default will abort after 50 data validation or read/write errors. If one or more but less than the specified amount of errors occur, Vdbench at the end of the run (elapsed=) will abort.

 

There are three ways to define the error count:

| 参数                        | 说明                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| data_errors=nndataerrors=nn | Causes an abort after nn validation errors. Default 50       |
| dataerrors="script_name"    | Causes this command/script to be executed after the first error, followed by an abort. This command can be used for diagnostic data collection and/or system dumps. When an error happens, no new i/o is started again allowing this script call to hopefully be run in a semi-idle system. |
| dataerrors=(nn,mm)          | Terminates the Vdbench run after ‘nn’ errors, or ‘mm’seconds after the last error. This gives Vdbench the chance to report more errors, but eliminates the possibilitythat Vdbench keeps running unnoticed for a long period of time after an error. |
| dataerrors=remove           | For raw (SD/WD) I/O: The failing SD will be removed but I/O will continue to all others. |
| dataerrors=(remove,nn)      | Same, but the SD will only be removed for nn seconds afterwhich i/o will start again. |

 

The command syntax under ‘data_errors=script_name’ can be as follows:

data_errors= "script_name $output $lun $lba $size $sector $error". After the error, the script is called with substituted values for 'output directory name', 'LUN name', 'lba', and 'data transfer size’. This allows for quicker collection of diagnostic data.

‘$sector’ will contain the failing sector address (in bytes) during a Data Validation error. It will contain ‘-1’ for a read or write error.

‘$error’ will contain ‘r’ or ‘w’ for read or write error. It will contain the internal Data Validation error flags for a Data Validation error. See source file BadSector.java for an explanation of those flags.

Note: ‘’lba’ and ‘sector’ when using the Vdbench raw i/o functionality will always be the same. When using file system functionality though Vdbench internally concatenates all files within an FSD into one large ‘pretend to be a lun’ setup. In that case ‘lba’ is the lba within the file that failed, and ‘sector’ is the reported block within the concatenation.



### 3. 'startcmd=' and 'endcmd='

Until Vdbench 503 these parameters were known as 'start_cmd' and 'end_cmd' and can continue to be used. Double quotes must be used if any of the commands include a blank.

You may specify one or more commands: startcmd=(cmd1,cmd2,….), each of course using parentheses if needed.

 

You may also add 'cons', 'sum', or 'log' as an extra parameter, with 'log' being the default. This parameter determines where the output of these commands will be sent: the console, summary.html, or to logfile.html. Example: startcmd=("echo hello world", cons)

 

|                                               |                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (Similar syntax for both startcmd and endcmd) |                                                              |
| startcmd=command1                             | Run 'command1' on the first slave on a host, sendingoutput to file '*stdout.html' |
| startcmd=("xxx yyy",cons)                     | Run 'xxx yyy' sending output to the console.                 |
| startcmd=(cmd,master)                         | Run 'cmd' on the master; default ‘slave’. Note: When used as a General Parameter, startcmd will always run on the master. |
| startcmd=(cmd,sum)                            | Send output to summary.html                                  |
| startcmd=(cmd,log)                            | Send output to logfile.html (default)                        |



There are two places where you may use this parameter: Either as a general parameter specified at the beginning of a parameter file, or as part of a Run Definition (RD).

有两个地方可以使用这个参数：作为通用参数放在参数文件的开头，或者作为RD的一部分。

 

When used as a general parameter, 'startcmd=*cmd'* will be executed right before the first run; 'endcmd=*cmd'* will be executed immediately after the last run is finished or has failed. Whether 'endcmd' will run after a failure of course depends on the type of failure. The use of CTRL-C precludes 'endcmd' from being run.

**当作为通用参数时，****'startcmd=cmd'****会在本次运行前执行命令；****'endcmd=cmd'****会在全部运行结束或失败后立即执行。全部运行失败后** **'endcmd'** **是否会执行取决于错误的类型。当Vdbench运行过程中按CTRL-C后，不会执行****'endcmd'** **的命令。**

 

When used as a Run Definition parameter, 'startcmd=*cmd'* will be executed right before each run; 'endcmd=*cmd'* will be executed immediately after each run is finished.

**当作为RD的参数时，****'startcmd=cmd'** **会在每个运行开始前执行；****'endcmd=cmd'** **会在每个运行结束后立即执行。**

 

There is one extra parameter available: 'startcmd=(master,xxx)". By default the command will be run on the first slave on each client, but when you're running on a dozen clients that became a little too expensive. The 'master' parameter will now move the execution to the master JVM, of which there of course is just one.

**还有一个额外的参数可用：****'startcmd=(master,xxx)"****。****默认情况下，该命令会在每个客户端的第一个slave上运行，但是当你在十几个客户端运行时，就变得有些太昂贵了。这个****'master'****参数会将本次执行放到主JVM（当然，只有一个主JVM）上。**

 

Note that if you start a long running command you need to add '&' at the end of the command to allow asynchronous execution.

**注意，如果执行命令时间过长，记得在命令末尾添加** **'&'** **--- 这会以异步的方式执行。**

 

These commands or scripts can be used for anything you like. For example, 'uname –a' and 'psrinfo' come to mind.

**这些命令或脚本可以****随意使用****。例如，'uname -a'和'psrinfo'。**

 

A string containing '$output' in the requested command will be replaced by the output directory name requested using the '-o' execution parameter, allowing the command/script access to this directory name.

**请求命令中的'$output'字符串将被替换为使用'-o'执行参数请求的输出目录名称，使得命令/脚本可以访问该目录名称。这样设计旨在让命令更加灵活，可以动态地操作特定的输出目录。**

 

When starting Vdbench, the command 'config.sh –o *output.directory host1 .. hostn*' will always be executed. This allows any kind of preprocessing to be done, or in the default case, the gathering of configuration specific data. After this, 'my_config.sh –o *output.directory host1 .. hostn*' will be executed. 'my_config.sh' is there for you to use, and will not be replaced by a (re)installation of Vdbench.

**在启动Vdbench时，将始终执行命令'config.sh –o output.directory host1 .. hostn'。这允许进行各种预处理，或者在默认情况下，收集特定配置数据。之后，将执行'my_config.sh –o output.directory host1 .. hostn'。 'my_config.sh'供您使用，并且不会被（重新）安装Vdbench时替换。这个设计允许您自定义配置过程，保留您的自定义脚本。**

 

If you never want either of these scripts to be executed, create file 'noconfig' in the Vdbench directory.

**如果您不希望执行这两个脚本中的任何一个，请在Vdbench目录中创建一个名为'noconfig'的文件。** 

 

Note: Sometimes, depending on which system you are running on, config.sh can take a few seconds or sometimes minutes. If you don’t need this to run, simply create file 'noconfig' in the Vdbench directory.

**注意：有时取决于您所在的系统，config.sh可能需要几秒钟或者有时甚至几分钟的时间。如果您不需要运行此脚本，在Vdbench目录中创建一个名为'noconfig'的文件****即可****。**

 

Note: ‘config.sh’ is NOT called for Windows systems.

**注意：对于Windows系统，不会调用‘config.sh’。**

 

Starting Vdbench50407 the user may optionally create a new script directory under the PARENT directory of where Vdbench resides. For instance: /var/vdbench50407 contains vdbench, user may create /var/vdbscript/. Any script or command will be first searched for in /vdbscript/ and then in /var/vdbench50407/solaris(or)linux. If found that script will be used. This new option allows you to now have a permanent place for scripts called by Vdbench without worrying that a re-install of Vdbench will overlay whatever you have there.

**在启动Vdbench50407时，用户可以选择在Vdbench所在的PARENT目录下创建一个新的脚本目录。例如：/var/vdbench50407 包含 vdbench，用户可以创建 /var/vdbscript/。任何脚本或命令将****首先在 /vdbscript/ 中查找，然后在 /var/vdbench50407/solaris（或）linux 中查找。如果找到，将使用该脚本。****这个新选项允许您为 Vdbench 调用的脚本提供一个永久的位置，而不必担心重新安装 Vdbench 会覆盖您已有的内容。**

 

 

### 4. 'pattern=: Data Pattern to be used

By default Vdbench writes a random non-compressible, non dedupable data pattern. See also the 'compratio=' and 'dedupratio=' parameters.

**默认情况下，Vdbench会生成一种随机的、不可压缩、不可重复的数据模式。****可以****查看 'compratio=' 和 'dedupratio=' 参数。**

 

| 参数               | 说明                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pattern=/file/name | The data found in this file is copied as often as possible into the data pattern buffer. |
|                    |                                                              |



### 5. ‘compratio=nn’: Set compression for data patterns

 See also pattern= above.

**另请参阅上述的 "pattern="。**

 

By default Vdbench will write an uncompressible random data pattern. 'compratio=nn' generates a data pattern that results in a nn:1 ratio.

**默认情况下，Vdbench 会创建一个无法压缩的随机数据模式。通过设置 'compratio=nn'，可以生成一个数据模式，使得压缩后的数据与原始数据的比率为 nn:1。**

 

Understanding that there are different compression algorithms this parameter cannot guarantee the ultimate results. The data patterns implemented are based on the use of the ‘LZJB' compression algorithm using a ZFS record size of 128k, and with that in mind the accuracy for this implementation is plus or minus 5%.

**由于存在多种压缩算法，该参数无法保证最终的压缩效果。Vdbench 实现的数据模式是基于使用 128k ZFS 记录大小的 ‘LZJB' 压缩算法。因此，该实现的压缩精度大约在正负 5% 的范围内。**

 

This parameter may be overridden using the ‘forcompratio=’ parameter.

**可以使用 'forcompratio=' 参数覆盖此参数。**

 

This is how the data pattern is generated:

**以下是数据模式的生成过程：**

 

1. A one-megabyte minimum data pattern buffer is filled with random numbers. This is done only once.

将最小为一兆字节的数据模式缓冲区填满随机数。这个过程只执行一次。

 

2. A number of random 32-bit words will be replaced with zeroes, this depending on the compratio= parameter used. The number of zeros is based on experiments done using the LZJB compression algorithm with 128k ZFS recordsize; compression ratios 1:1 through 25:1 are the only ones implemented; any ratio larger than 25:1 will be set to 25.

根据指定的 compratio= 参数，将一定数量的随机 32 位字符替换为零。这些零的数量是基于使用 128k ZFS 记录大小的 LZJB 压缩算法进行的实验得出的；目前只实现了 1:1 到 25:1 的压缩比；超过 25:1 的比率将被调整为 25:1。

 

3. Data starting at the pattern buffer + (remainder of the Logical Byte Address (lba) divided by the length of the pattern buffer) is copied into the data buffer. The copy wraps around to the beginning of the pattern buffer if needed. This takes care of the requested compression ratio.

从模式缓冲区的某个位置开始（这个位置是逻辑字节地址 (lba) 除以模式缓冲区长度的余数），将数据复制到数据缓冲区中。如果需要，复制过程会从模式缓冲区的开头继续。这一步骤确保了所需的压缩比得以实现。

 

4. The first 8 bytes of each 4k portion of the data buffer is overlaid by a combination of lba, 4k offset, file handle, and the lower four bytes of the system's High Resolution Timer (HRT). This is done to make sure that the data can not be deduped. See also the dedupratio= parameter.

为了确保数据不能被去重，每个 4k 数据块的前 8 个字节会被逻辑字节地址、4k 偏移量、文件句柄和系统的高精度计时器 (HRT) 的低四位字节的组合所覆盖。关于去重的更多信息，请参考 dedupratio= 参数。

 

### 6. ‘port=nnnn’: Specify port number for Java sockets.

Vdbench communicates between the master and slave JVMs using Java sockets, using port 5570. If on your system this port is already used by something else you may override this setting using the ‘port=nnn’ parameter.

Since with Vdbench you can create and execute as many different workloads as you can think of, running more than one Vdbench run at the same time should not be necessary. However, if you choose to do so your Vdbench could run into connection problems if it tries to connect to the same port that another Vdbench execution already is using. To eliminate this risk, Vdbench will increment the port number by one when it gets a connection failure to see if that connection will be successful. Vdbench will do this a maximum of eight times before it gives up. The end result is that it will try to use ports 5570 through 5578 (default).

Starting Vdbench50402 however the connection port will be released as soon as the master and all of its slaves are connected making the port available again for other copies of Vdbench. The chance that you will ever need more than 8 ports therefore is very small.

 

You can also use the ‘-p nnnn’ execution parameter to override the port number, or override the used port numbers permanently using the ‘[portnumbers.txt](#_bookmark230)’ file.

 

 

### 7. ‘create_anchors=yes’: Create anchor parent directory

The anchor directory for a File System Definition (FSD) is automatically created if it does not exist. However, its parent directories will NOT be created. Use ‘create_anchors=yes’ to also include the creation of the parent directories.

 

### 8. ‘report=’: Generate extra SD reports.

By default Vdbench will create a separate report with detailed statistics for each SD. Starting Vdbench 5.02 Vdbench will no longer create SD reports for each slave or host (200 SDs over 8 slaves plus one host creates 1800 reports!). To still create these detail reports specify report=host_detail or report=slave_detail or abbreviated report=(host,slave) depending on your needs.

report=no_sd_detail will completely suppress the creation of SD reports.

 

### 9. ‘histogram=’: set bucket count and bucket size for response time histograms.

Response time histograms allow you to get a more detailed understanding of I/O response times. Vdbench already reports averages and maximums, but at times it can be very useful to know what variation there is in response times. The histograms for instance can give you some indication as to how much of the I/O was handled from storage system cache and which ones had to really come from spinning disk. Note of course that the response time can vary depending on the data transfer size and the queue depth.

 

The 'histogram=(default,nn,…,nn)' parameter defines how many histogram buckets there are and what the range of the buckets is. The default is: histogram=(default,20,40,60,80,100,200,400,600,800,1m,2m,4m,6m,8m,10m,20m,40m,60m,80m,100m,200m,400m,600m,800m,1s,2s) (All in one line).

Values are in microseconds, you may also specify u(micro), m(milli) or s(seconds). You may specify a maximum of 64 buckets).

 

You may permanently override the default by creating file 'histogram.txt' with a valid histogram parameter inside of your Vdbench installation directory.

 

Data reported in the histograms will exclude all warmup intervals.

 

 

### 10. ‘formatxfersize=nnnn’

When Vdbench creates new or expands existing disk files specified using SD parameters the default is xfersize=128k. (xfersize=512 for files smaller than 128k). To override this default, specify formatxfersize=nnn.)

 

 

### 11. 'monitor=', External control of Vdbench termination

Vdbench runs terminate after 'elapsed=nnn' seconds, or, when 'seekpct=eof' is used after 'elapsed=nnn' seconds or when EOF is reached on the last SD, whichever is first.

 

There are TWO ways to allow external control of Vdbench shutdown:

 

#### 11.1 Shutdown via temporary file

At the end of each reporting interval Vdbench looks for file '*$temp*/vdbench.shutdown*.$pid*', where '$temp' is the system TEMP directory, and '$pid' is the process-id of the Vdbench master JVM. When that file is found, Vdbench will shut down cleanly.

The '$temp' directory name as used by Java is displayed at the top in logfile.html, look for 'java.io.tmpdir'.

 

#### 11.2 Shutdown via monitor=parameter

The monitor*=/monitor/file/name* parameter allows you to terminate the currently active run, or even the complete Vdbench execution.

 

Vdbench at the end of each reporting interval will look at the monitor file name, and depending on its contents will either terminate the current run, or will terminate Vdbench.

 

Vdbench will always start with erasing the monitor file, but after that will check the file contents each interval:

 

· *end_rd* will terminate the current run AFTER the next reporting interval.

· *end_vdbench* will terminate Vdbench AFTER the next reporting interval, skipping any still remaining Run Definitions..



### 12. 'messagescan=': suppress /var/xxx/messages scan

By default on Solaris /var/adm/messages, and on Linux /var/log/message is scanned every five seconds to look for error messages that possibly could be related to the workload you are running.

The 'messagescan=' parameter give you some control over this.

| 参数                  | 说明                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| messagescan=no        | suppresses the scan                                          |
| messagescan=yes       | Keeps the default                                            |
| messagescan=nodisplay | Does the scan, but does not display the messages found on stdout. |
| messagescan=1000      | Stop scanning after 1000 messages. (default)                 |

 

### 13. timeout=(nn,script)

This new general parameter causes Vdbench to keep track of how long an SD or FSD has not completed any i/o or FWD operations on a slave.

At the end of each reporting interval Vdbench keeps track of consecutive periods where the I/O count for an SD or FSD reported by a slave is zero. To prevent false reporting Vdbench will not check for timeouts for a workload that may complete before the specified elapsed time, for instance any workload using ‘seekpct=eof’ or ‘format=yes’.

| 参数                                                         | 说明                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| timeout=report                                               | Vdbench at normal termination will report any SD or FSD that had zeroi/o for more than one second. |
| timeout=(report,60)                                          | Same, but for more than 60 seconds.                          |
| timeout=60                                                   | Will print a message every 60 seconds for those SDs or FSDs that arenot completing any I/O. |
| timeout=(60,abort)                                           | Will abort Vdbench if it does not see any i/o completions for 60 seconds |
| timeout=(60,600)                                             | Vdbench will warn about timeout every 60 seconds, but will abort after600 seconds if the problem is not resolved. |
| timeout=(60,script.sh)                                       | Will call 'script.sh', and if the script returns 'abort', Vdbench will abort. Any other value returned by the script will cause vdbench to continue. The script will be called again ‘nn’ seconds later if the timeout continues.This script will also be called when Vdbench fails to properly terminate during a run’s shutdown. At the end of elapsed= seconds all i/o outstanding at that time MUST complete, and Vdbench waits for it to complete for a maximum of five minutes. Vdbench then will abort after calling this script. |
