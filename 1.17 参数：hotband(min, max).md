'Hotband=(min,max)': Create a skewed workload over a Limited Seek Range



By default, the whole SD or concatenated SD will be used to generate a random LBA. To limit the lba range for a workload, specify the starting and ending range of the SD: 'hotband=(40,60)' will limit I/O activity starting at 40% into the SD and ending at 60% into the SD. If the max value is larger than 100 but smaller than 200, Vdbench will consider this a wrap across the end of your SD. For instance with hotband=(90,110) , Vdbench will generate an I/O workload using the last 10% and the first 10% of your volume. When the values are greater than 200, the values will be considered given in *bytes* instead of in *percentages*; e.g., ‘Hotband=(1g,2g)’.

Hotband has a skewed workload across the defined range.  The probability (Pb) accessing a block in the range is biased toward lower LBAs	It is intended to simulate something similar to database index. This access will allow for systems with a small cache to have a small cache hit. Systems with larger caches, have larger cache hit rates. The cache rate does not increase linearly as system cache size increases. Here is a sample scatter plot of four hotbands and the intensity of access is skewed to lower LBA.  The X axis is the storage LBA range, the Y axis is time.
