The operations that you can specify are: mkdir, rmdir, create, delete, open, close, read, write, access, getattr and setattr. These are the operations that Vdbench will execute. After a run against an NFS directory if you look at the nfs3/4.html files (they are linked to from kstat.html) you’ll see the nfsstat reported counts. *These counts do not include the operations that were either handled from file system cache or from inode cache.* Even if you mount the file systems for instance with *forcedirectio* and *noac* there is no guarantee that the nfsstat counts match one-for- one the work done by Vdbench. For instance, one single stat() C function request translates into four NFS getattr requests.

The only way for the Vdbench and nfsstat counts to possibly match is if Vdbench would use native NFS code. This is not within the scope of Vdbench.

Also, nfsstat shows a total of **all** NFS operations, not only of what Vdbench is running against your specific file system. If you have a dedicated system for testing then you can control how much other NFS work there is going on. To make sure that Vdbench reporting does not generate extra NFS activity, use the Vdbench ‘-output’ parameter to send the Vdbench output to a non NFS file system.
