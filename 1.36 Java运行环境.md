It is expected that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) already has been installed.  Vdbench expects Java 1.7 or higher.

Follow the vendor's installation instructions.

 

It is OK to install java in your own private directory; there is no need to override the existing version of java that is already present. Modify either your standard search path, or change the vdbench or vdbench.bat script changing 'java=java' to point to the proper java executable, which normally is /some/thing/bin/java(.exe)

 

#### **1.35.1** ***\*Java and Garbage\**** ***\*Collection.\****

The current default of -Xmx1024m of java heapsize available for each Vdbench slave/JVM likety will cover 95+% of all Vdbench executions. However, if you are running a huge amount of threads and/or a huge amount of files and directories, this limit either may not be enough causing Vdbench to abort, or may dramatically slow down the speed with which Vdbench runs because of java garbage collection.

To help you with this Vdbench50403 has added some new functionality that reports when it sees that garbage collection has been done. This is reported on a slave's stdout.html file.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cum:      | Cumulative count of how many times GC was done.              |
| intv:     | How many GC's were done since the last time GC data was collected |
| ms:       | Number of milliseconds that GC was active since the last time GC data wascollected.<br />A few milliseconds is normal, and this will be done asynchronously. If you start running out of java heap space though the amount of time GC is active can becomelarge, and sometimes this will run synchronous, causing Vdbench to temporarily come to a halt. No indication however is given when GC is done synchronously. |
| mss:      | Milliseconds per second: ms / 'time between the last two sets of GC data'. I am notsure if this field is accurate or useful. |
| Heap max: | Maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use.This usually equates to the -Xmx value specified minus internal java overhead. |
| curr:     | The total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine.      |
| used:     | 'curr - free'                                                |
| free:     | The amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine        |
|           |                                                              |

 

#### **1.35.2** ***\*Java and 'unable to create new native\**** ***\*thread'\****

 

This message may be displayed by java when it is creating so many threads that the OS refuses to start new threads. I do not understand the complexities of this, but a usual solution to this problem is to lower the specified or default -Xss value for SlaveJvm in the vdbench script. I have not really been able to find very clear information about this, but usually changing the current default -Xss value (it would be nice btw if java would display what the default is), lowering it to still be above the required minimum -Xss value (which is also not displayed), this change usually helps.

What some times will also help is to increase the amount of slaves/JVMs which will then split the amount of requested threads over more OS processes/JVMs.

I'll leave this over to the experts.
