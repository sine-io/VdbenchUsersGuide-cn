Follow the vendor's installation instructions.

It is OK to install java in your own private directory; there is no need to override the existing version of java that is already present. Modify either your standard search path, or change the `vdbench` or `vdbench.bat` script changing `java=java` to point to the proper java executable, which normally is `/some/thing/bin/java(.exe)`

请按照供应商的安装说明进行操作。

可以将Java安装在您自己的私有目录中；无需覆盖已经存在的Java版本。修改您的标准搜索路径，或者更改`vdbench`或`vdbench.bat`脚本，将`java=java`指向正确的Java可执行文件，通常位于`/some/thing/bin/java(.exe)`。

 

### 1. Java and Garbage Collection.

The current default of `-Xmx1024m` of java heapsize available for each Vdbench slave/JVM likety will cover 95+% of all Vdbench executions. However, if you are running a huge amount of threads and/or a huge amount of files and directories, this limit either may not be enough causing Vdbench to abort, or may dramatically slow down the speed with which Vdbench runs because of java garbage collection.

To help you with this Vdbench50403 has added some new functionality that reports when it sees that garbage collection has been done. This is reported on a slave's `stdout.html` file.



Java的默认堆大小为`-Xmx1024m`，对于每个Vdbench从属/JVM实例来说，这通常能够覆盖95%以上的所有Vdbench执行情况。然而，如果您运行的线程数量或文件和目录数量非常庞大，这个限制可能不够，导致Vdbench中止，或者由于Java垃圾回收而显著减慢Vdbench运行速度。

为了帮助您解决这个问题，Vdbench50403增加了一些新功能，用于报告垃圾回收的情况。这些信息会显示在从属的`stdout.html`文件中。

| 参数      | 说明                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cum:      | Cumulative count of how many times GC was done.              |
| intv:     | How many GC's were done since the last time GC data was collected |
| ms:       | Number of milliseconds that GC was active since the last time GC data wascollected.<br />A few milliseconds is normal, and this will be done asynchronously. If you start running out of java heap space though the amount of time GC is active can becomelarge, and sometimes this will run synchronous, causing Vdbench to temporarily come to a halt. No indication however is given when GC is done synchronously. |
| mss:      | Milliseconds per second: ms / 'time between the last two sets of GC data'. I am notsure if this field is accurate or useful. |
| Heap max: | Maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use. This usually equates to the -Xmx value specified minus internal java overhead. |
| curr:     | The total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine.      |
| used:     | 'curr - free'                                                |
| free:     | The amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine        |
|           |                                                              |

 

### 2. Java and 'unable to create new native thread'

This message may be displayed by java when it is creating so many threads that the OS refuses to start new threads. I do not understand the complexities of this, but a usual solution to this problem is to lower the specified or default `-Xss` value for SlaveJvm in the vdbench script. I have not really been able to find very clear information about this, but usually changing the current default -Xss value (it would be nice btw if java would display what the default is), lowering it to still be above the required minimum `-Xss` value (which is also not displayed), this change usually helps.

What some times will also help is to increase the amount of slaves/JVMs which will then split the amount of requested threads over more OS processes/JVMs.

I'll leave this over to the experts.



这个消息通常出现在Java创建了太多线程导致操作系统拒绝启动新线程时。我对这方面的细节了解有限，但通常解决此问题的方法是降低vdbench脚本中SlaveJvm的指定或默认`-Xss`值。我没有找到很清晰的解决方案，但通常将当前默认的-Xss值降低到仍然高于所需的最小`-Xss`值可能会有所帮助。同时，增加从属/JVM的数量有时也会分散请求的线程数量到更多的操作系统进程/JVM中，有助于缓解这个问题。

我会将这个问题留给专家们。
