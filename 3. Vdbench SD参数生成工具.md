The creation of SD parameters can become quite cumbersome on Solaris since it uses very long hexadecimal target numbers as part of their device names.

This tool is also available for Linux and Windows, though the ’50 or more hexadecimal characters per device name’ problem does not exist there.

 

The SD parameter generation tool will assist you in the selection of the proper device names and then the creation of a set of SD parameters (or other parameters, see below).

The program either takes in a file containing the output of ‘format << EOF’, or runs the command itself. The ‘prtvtoc’ command is run when available for each device found so that it can display the partition sizes for partitions 0 through 7.

Click and select one or more of the device names on the right side of the window, then click on the ‘<<<<<’ button and the selected device(s) will be added to the list of SDs. A double click will immediately move the selected device. Click ‘Save’ to then save the selected SDs into a file. The ‘Replace parmfile’ button will read an existing parameter file, and replace the existing SDs within that file with the new SD parameters just created.

Note: since the new SDs are all labeled sd*1* through sd*n*, SD parameters in this parameter file that use different SD names can no longer be referenced, e.g. wd=wd1,sd=disk1.

 

You can also use this program to use the selected device names for anything else. For that the program takes as input a *mask*. By default the mask contains:

 

```shell
sd=sd#,lun=/dev/rdsk/$%
```

Where:

· # is replaced by a sequence number, starting from 1

· $ is replaced by the selected device name.

· % is replaced by the entered partition/slice number.

 

You can modify the mask either by directly entering it on the screen, or by adding it to file ‘build_sds.txt’ in your Vdbench installtion directory.

Any mask containing '<' and '>' will be split in two, with the objective of the left mask (until '<') being used for the first disk, and the right side of the mask (inside '<' and '>') being used for all other disks. This allows the creation of a single command with multiple disks and command continuation characters ('\').

 

A mask containing the ‘<’ and ‘>’ characters allows you to create a multi-line command, for instance:

 

newfs </dev/dsk/$%> used for two devices will create (after ‘Save’) a file containing:

```shell
newfs /dev/dsk/c1t0d0s6 \

/dev/dsk/c1t1d0s6
```

 

Below are the currently defined masks in file ‘build_sds.txt’. If you have any other ideas for things to add let me know.

```shell

* This is the hardcoded default:
sd=sd#,lun=/dev/rdsk/$%

* Placed in a script this should label this disk printf "label\nyes\nquit\n" | format -d $

* This results in only a list of disks:
$

* Create a file system for one disk: printf "yes\n" | newfs /dev/dsk/$%

* Create a file system for multiple disks: newfs </dev/dsk/$%>

* Testing:
ls -l </dev/dsk/$%>

```
